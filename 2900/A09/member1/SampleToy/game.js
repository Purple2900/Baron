//Mod 1: Grid background from black to white
//Mod 2: Changed grid dimensions to 14 by 10
//Mod 3: Changed click sound effect from "fx_click" to "fx_drip1"
//Mod 4: All beads start off as the color blue
//Mod 5: When you click the same bead, it alternates between black and blue

PS.init( system, options )
Called once after engine is initialized but before event-polling begins.
This function doesn't have to do anything, although initializing the grid dimensions with PS.gridSize() is recommended.
If PS.grid() is not called, the default grid dimensions (8 x 8 beads) are applied.
Any value returned is ignored.
[system : Object] = A JavaScript object containing engine and host platform information properties; see API documentation for details.
[options : Object] = A JavaScript object with optional data properties; see API documentation for details.

PS.touch ( x, y, data, options )
Called when the left mouse button is clicked over bead(x, y), or when bead(x, y) is touched.
This function doesn't have to do anything. Any value returned is ignored.
[x : Number] = zero-based x-position (column) of the bead on the grid.
[y : Number] = zero-based y-position (row) of the bead on the grid.

[options : Object] = A JavaScript object with optional data properties; see API documentation for details.
